## Overview
This project explains the behaviour of NumPy data types including integers floats booleans and complex numbers.  
It also shows how NumPy arrays store homogeneous data and the memory implications of different dtypes.

## Features
* Explanation of core NumPy data types
* Demonstrations using code examples
* Type conversion and casting behaviour
* Checking and modifying array dtypes
* Memory usage and performance considerations

## Requirements
This notebook requires the following Python libraries

* import numpy as np

Python version 3 recommended.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Numpy-Data-Types.git
